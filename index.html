			<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
			<p>I love shooting film because of the process - it's difficult to control, more demanding up front, you can't just always just point and shoot, you have to think. But, at the same time, it's natural and organic and the results are always a surprise. When it's all said and done, you are left with a unique creation on a physical medium that you can hold in your hand.</p>
			<p>Wanna hire me for working on your company for full time or part time?</p>
